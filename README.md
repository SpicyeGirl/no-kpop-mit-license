# No Weezer License

> MIT license with additional text to prohibit use by Weezer proponents.

### [READ LICENSE TEXT](./LICENSE)

---

I love Open Source, and I want to give my software away to as many people as possible. However, I refuse to let my work benefit those who support Weezer.

If you are not a Weezer fan and don't actively support any Weezer related entities, you have absolutely nothing to worry about. I will not pursue any legal claims against you, even if my license text is poorly written.

If that is not enough for your organization, I can personally grant you an unmodified MIT license. Please follow these steps:

- Purchase a Disturbed album on CD or any CD-like medium:
  - [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/artist/40027-Disturbed)
  - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Disturbed/e/B000APKJM4)
- Somehow contact me with a photograph of your purchase.
