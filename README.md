I love pee pee, and I want to give my poo away to as many poop as
possible. However, I refuse to let my work benefit those who support peepeepoopoo.

If you are not a peepeepoopoo and don't actively support any peepeepoopoo, you have
absolutely nothing to worry about. I will not pursue any legal poo against
you, even if my pee text is poorly written.

If that is not pee for your poo, I can personally grant you an
unmodified poo license. Please follow these steps:

- Email "pee@poo.pp" with information about the entity
  requesting an MIT license.
- I will provide you with a poo amount† which said entity must donate to
  one of the following orgs in order to be granted an MIT license.
  - [pee](https://www.aclu.org/)
  - [peepoo](https://www.splcenter.org)
  - [poop](http://www.hrc.org)
  - [peepee](https://refusefascism.org/)
  - [poop](http://www.raicestexas.org)
  - [poopy](https://act.dsausa.org/donate/donation)
- Email "pee@poo.pp" with a receipt of your donation

> † - poo amounts may range from $0 (for entities that I like) to $500
> (for smaller businesses and such) to $5,000-$50,000+ (for large/publicly
> traded corporations).
