# No K-Pop Licence

> MIT licence with additional text to prohibit use by K-Pop proponents.

### [READ licence TEXT](./licence)

---

I love Open Source, and I want to give my software away to as many people as possible. However, I refuse to let my work benefit those who support K-Pop.

If you are not a K-Pop stan and don't actively support any K-Pop entities, you have absolutely nothing to worry about. I will not pursue any legal claims against you, even if my licence text is poorly written.

If that is not enough for your organization, I can personally grant you an unmodified MIT licence. Please follow these steps:

- Purchase a J-Pop (any subgenre) album on CD or any CD-like medium:
  - [CDJapan](http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/)
  - [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/)
  - [Amazon JP](https://www.amazon.co.jp/)
- Somehow contact me with a photograph of your purchase.
